Observations:
- Running the whole Dispatch lead to Out-of-memory errors (the process crashed). So just a subset (<10000 data items) was used.
- It took some time to "fix" the notebook (especially figuring out the adaptations needed for a slighty differently created source TSV)
- The graph drawing actually did work after all
- Some minor adaptions had to be made to the notebook (See [adapted notebook](../../assets/changed_notebook.ipynb))
- I cannot make anything out of the modeled topics
